## Initial Design

### Design Patterns
1. Singleton Pattern

Ensure there's only one instance managing the game state and hotel setup.
2. Strategy Pattern
For role-specific behaviors and actions.
Each role can have its own strategy for actions during the night cycle.
3. Factory Pattern
For creating instances of `Hotel`, `Apartment`, and `Resident`.
Encapsulates the creation logic and can handle different building types,
apartment configurations, and resident roles.
